Simple overview of UrbanSound8K dataset with using Streamlit's features

#Deployment
It's public repository so if you want to deploy it copy the main.py URL to your share.streamlit.io

#Installation
To use it on a local install project folder and use a virtual environment or a conda environment with dependencies stated in requirements.txt

#Further
You can use the audio dataset for your Deep Learning study, create a nn model and integrate into Streamlit whether local or global web.
There is a metadata on original [page](https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html).
I defined a Tensorflow model, and it classified urban sounds within ten (10) labels. You can get to link [urbanStreamlit](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Enise/urbanstreamlit)
